Generating SSH keys is a straightforward process that you can do on most operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. SSH keys are a pair of cryptographic keys that can be used to authenticate to an SSH server as an alternative to password-based logins. A private key, which is secret, and a public key, which is shared, are generated. Here's how to generate SSH keys on different systems:

On Linux or macOS
Open Terminal: You can do this by searching for it in your applications or pressing Ctrl + Alt + T on most Linux distributions.
Generate SSH Key: Type the following command:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
